# React Weather

Based on a React lecture at Udemy,  [https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-web-app-developer-course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-web-app-developer-course)

Changed what API returns to add the canonical city name from the weather service. If the user types in a misspelled version that is still found by the API, the correct name will be displayed instead.
